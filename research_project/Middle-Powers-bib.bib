Both the older and the modern writers have used the term 'middle powers' in various senses and have failed to draw up satisfactory criteria for distinguishing them from other states. Yet, it is possible to examine the roles of middle-sized powers by studying their behaviour in a variety of historical situations. Here their typical roles arc outlined in several distinct situations of the 'bipolar' system, namely, cold war, condominium and d{\'e}tente, as well as in two characteristic situations of the 'multipolar' system, namely, concert and competitive balance of power.},

  abstract = {The emergence of newly prominent participants (NPPs) in global governance has led to a revival of scholarly interest in the concept of middle powers. Because NPPs do not share the characteristics of ``classical'' middle powers, analysts have attempted to salvage the concept by adding various qualifiers. In doing so, they have further reduced its analytical utility. The concept of ``entrepreneurial'' states extracts the valuable components of the literature on middle powers while avoiding the problems arising from the conflation of two elements of behaviour---strategic and purposive. Entrepreneurial states are countries that seek to gain the support of others in pursuit of their perceived interests in the international system. They may be supporters of the current system, or seek to change it fundamentally. We investigate what attributes are necessary for states to behave in an entrepreneurial manner through studies of both successful and failed attempts at policy entrepreneurship.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper argues that MIKTA (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey, and Australia) are middle, regional, and constructive powers that can serve as providers of global governance in the international system. In order to support this idea, the paper first reviews the literature on these concepts, arguing that they can be complementary. Then, it explains why the MIKTA countries can be defined as middle, regional and constructive powers. To do so, it describes what MIKTA is, as well the common characteristics, objectives, and strategies that the countries that compose this mechanism share. Finally, it argues that in order for MIKTA countries to serve as middle, regional, and constructive powers, they need to consolidate the support of all relevant State and non-State actors in their countries, allowing MIKTA to become a relevant mechanism to promote and generate public goods in the international system, specially global governance.},

  abstract = {During the early 1990s, the Hawke and Keating Labor governments promoted Australia's diplomatic credentials as an activist and independent middle power. Labor claimed that by acting as a middle power Australia was constructing a novel diplomatic response to the challenges of the post-Cold War world. But a closer reading of the official foreign policy record since 1945 reveals that previous conservative governments have also taken a similar view of Australia's place and position on the international stage. This essay traces the historical evolution of the middle power concept in Australian foreign policy and concludes with an assessment of the Howard government's more recent reluctance to use this label and its implications for Australia's future middle power credentials. Although its use has waxed and waned in official policy discourse and it is more commonly associated with Labor governments, the middle power concept itself and the general diplomatic style it conveys have been one of the most durable and consistent elements of Australia's diplomatic practice.},
